Materials from the "STEBAM: Expanding STEAM Education with Biomedical Engineering" project

The efficacy of STEAM interventions in reducing education inequalities and enhancing student outcomes has been recently highlighted, as they cultivate both technical and soft skills. However, the incorporation of the biomedical engineering thematic remains significantly uncharted. With this work, we contribute to bridge this gap by combining low-cost hardware with low-code biosignal data acquisition and processing. Didactic materials were also developed to be used during initiatives such as workshops for high school students. They include a DIY solderable electronic kit and two pedagogical experiments where students can interact with the kit's biomedical sensors in a fun and captivating way, namely by computing their heart-rate from a PPG sensor and controlling a dart-shooter using EMG signals. This work demonstrates that engaging, hands-on initiatives can effectively enhance students' understanding of biomedical concepts, and foster interest in STEM fields among high school students.
